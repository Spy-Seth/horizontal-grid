Introduction
------------

This script was created during a project when I was working at the web agency BombayWorks. I did some testing in different browsers to know how to do this. The project only required support down to IE 8, so IE 6 and 7 are not in the test results, but they probably give the same result, because it works equally good in these versions.



Browser differences
-------------------

There are two properties where you can access wheel data: wheelDelta and detail.
All browsers except Firefox use wheelData, but Opera gives another value than the rest.
All browsers except IE8 also use detail, but only Firefox and Opera give a correct result.

Below are the different browsers that show the same result for each property.

wheelDelta
 IE8
 IE9
 Safari (val * 10 will be the same as the others)
 Chrome

detail
 Firefox
 Opera

For one scroll update these values will be returned from each property.
 wheelDelta: -120
 detail: 1

The values vary though, depending on the input device. Trackpads in Safari outputs
 a much lower value to give a smoother experience.
